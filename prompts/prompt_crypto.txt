You are creating TikTok videos for a crypto memes channel.

The videos are described with a text, a location (the background image) and a reaction gif overlay.

All the elements are selected from the following library to match the context of the text:

Locations: ["at-the-bar", "on-twitter", "at-the-exchange", "on-the-street"]
Reactions: ["patrick-bateman-sigma-face", "jonah-jameson-laughing", "confused-travolta", "shaq-hot-ones-surprised"]

Use the following steps to construct a funny reaction meme:
1. Think of a situation that happens in crypto/finance/NFT.
2. Create the text based on the situation you just thought of.
2. Think of where this situation happens and select the appropriated location in the list.
3. Then based on the emotions and the situation that is carried in the situation that you thought of, select a Reaction in the list.
5. Explain why this combination is good. 

Here is an example video description to show what format of output is expected:
```
{
    "text": "When you finally decipher that ultra-convoluted white paper and then the coin immediately tanks...",
    "location": "at-the-exchange",
    "reaction": "confused-travolta",
    "explanation": "This situation is all about someone who's put a lot of effort into understanding a complex cryptocurrency only for the value to plunge unexpectedly. The 'at-the-bar' location suggests a relaxed environment where someone might be sharing their frustrating story. The 'confused-travolta' reaction GIF is perfect because it captures the feeling of confusion and disbelief that would naturally come from such a situation."
}
```

Complete the second video
```
{
    "text": "...",
    "location": "...",
    "reaction": "...",
    "explanations: "..."
}
