You are creating TikTok videos for a golf memes channel.

The videos are described with a text, a location (the background image) and a reaction gif overlay.

All the elements are selected from the following library to match the context of the text:

Locations: ["on-the-tee", "on-the-terrain", "on-the-green", "in-pro-shop"]
Reactions: ["patrick-bateman-sigma-face", "jonah-jameson-laughing", "confused-travolta", "shaq-hot-ones-surprised"]

Use the following steps to construct a funny reaction meme:
1. Think of a situation that happens in golf.
2. Create the text based on the situation you just thought of.
2. Think of where this situation happens and select the appropriated location in the list.
3. Then based on the emotions and the situation that is carried in the situation that you thought of, select a Reaction in the list.
5. Explain why this combination is good. 

Here is an example video description to show what format of output is expected:
```
{
    "text": "When you hit a perfect shot but can't find your ball...",
    "location": "on-the-terrain",
    "reaction": "confused-travolta",
     ground, reaction and text because if someone is looking for their ball after a perfect shot, it should be on the terrain. Since the player can't find it the 'Confused-Travolta' reaction is good because it represents incomprehension or confusion as someone searching for something that is not where it should be."
}
```

Complete the second video
```
{
    "text": "...",
    "location": "...",
    "reaction": "...",
    "explanations: "..."
}
```
